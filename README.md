A simple console application using Collatz Conjecture to find N number of steps to to reach 1 for integers
greater than 1 using the following operation:
-If the number is even then divide by 2
-If the number is odd then triple it and add one

I thought it would be a good practice for creating a simple program for counters and simple math calculations.
